# pizza-sales-data-engineering-project



In a recent project, I orchestrated a seamless data pipeline by leveraging MySQL, Azure Data Factory (ADF), and Databricks. Beginning with MySQL, I extracted and structured raw data sets, ensuring data integrity and quality. Employing Azure Data Factory, I orchestrated the efficient movement of this curated data to Azure, enabling a smooth transition to Databricks. Within Databricks, I implemented intricate transformations and analyses, utilizing the power of Spark to glean profound insights and generate actionable outcomes.
